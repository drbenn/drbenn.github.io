								<p>A Nissan 370Z as a 2nd car or Vanguard Mutual Funds VFIAX/VGSLX ?
								<br>
								What is it worth to you? Long story short...
								</p>
								<p>
								<ul>
							    <li>If you put $36,375 into the car and sold it after 5 years, you would have no second car and $19,486 to show for yourself.
							    </li>

							    <li>If you put $36,375 into VFIAX and sold all shares after 5 years, you would have still have no second car, but have $43,811 to show for yourself, an additional $24,395 – which if instead you kept invested would continue to grow and provide $218 in dividends each quarter.
							    </li>

							    <li>If you put $36,375 into VGSLX and sold all shares after 5 years, you would have still have no second car, but have $41,477 to show for yourself, an additional $21,991 – which if instead you kept invested would continue to grow and provide $372 in dividends each quarter.
							    </li>

							    <li>Instead of buying a second high-performance car, invest the time and (vastly smaller amounts of) money into your health. Prioritze making your body high-performance instead; Jean-Claude Van Damme, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger would all agree.
							    </li> 
								</ul>
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								<b>Methodology</b>
								<br>
								Started on the ‘Auto Info’ tab, researching purchase and maintenance costs, model specific depreciation and financing rates. 
								<br>
								
								<ul>    	
							    <li>Lowest widely available financing rate of 2.69% used after 20% down payment.
							    </li>

							    <li>Ownership costs from Edmunds.com used. These numbers were cut in half to account for reduced weekend usage, expecting 7,500 miles per year rather than 15,000.
							    </li>

							    <li>Depreciation from Edmunds reduced to 75%, assuming age is 50% and mileage is 50% of depreciation, the mileage would be cut in half only.
							    </li>

							    <li>Generously allowed depreciation to play out over time instead of imposing a 10-20% decrease in value from driving it off the lot. Car Edge depreciation is included, however, was not used for calculations.
							    </li>
								</ul>
				    			<br>



								<p>
								For the Mutual Funds information, downloaded historical fund price and dividend data from yahoo finance. On ‘Fund Pivot’ tab found the average monthly share price movement and average dividend yield using the earliest starting date of November 2000 through November 2020 to apply to the the cash used on investments instead of sunk into the car.
								</p>
								<p>
								Tab ‘Auto vs Fund’ compares the scenarios, where you have the initial cash deposit on the asset of $6,6869 and then continually put the same amount of cash into the asset every month – and then sell all assets at the end of five years. Capital gains tax of 15% was applied to the gain in mutual fund. Dividends were taxed at the ordinary income level of someone earning $85,000/year – where although their marginal tax rate is 22% the actual average income tax rate at that level turns out to only be 14%.
